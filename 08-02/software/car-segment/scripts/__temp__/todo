1. process bar for csv generation

Next experiment plans:

baseline system:  using as 256x256 input and predict 256x256.

comparsion system:

     1. Given 256x256 images, crop 128x128 for training and predict 128x128.  During testing, 256x256 is divided into overlapping 128x128  patches to do inference. The results are then combined.

     2. Given 128x128 as input. Train to predict 256x256

     3. Given 128x128 as input. Train to predict 512x512. During testing, 512x512 prediction is downsized to 256x256.
